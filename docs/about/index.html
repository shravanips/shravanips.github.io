        <p>
          Hello! I’m <strong>Shravani Pranay Sawant</strong>, an MS Computer Science (Cybersecurity) student at Stevens Institute of Technology
          with a strong interest in building secure, reliable, and research-driven software systems. My journey into cybersecurity began with
          curiosity around how systems fail — and how thoughtful design, analysis, and security engineering can prevent those failures at scale.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my academic journey, I’ve worked across diverse areas including cybersecurity research, data-driven analysis, and applied system design.
          I enjoy translating complex problems into structured solutions, whether that’s through building experimental pipelines, analyzing large datasets,
          or developing security-focused tools that balance practicality with rigor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside coursework, I have been actively involved in research and academic projects spanning cybersecurity, forensics, and applied data exploration.
          My work has included studying emerging threats, evaluating system vulnerabilities, and contributing to published research. These experiences have shaped
          how I approach problems — with an emphasis on clarity, evidence, and long-term impact rather than quick fixes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond research, I’m drawn to engineering that lives close to real-world use cases: incident response workflows, secure system design, and software that
          supports decision-making under uncertainty. I value clean architecture, reproducibility, and documentation just as much as technical depth, and I enjoy
          collaborating in environments where learning and iteration are encouraged.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of technology, I have a creative side that keeps me grounded — from photography and visual storytelling to writing and personal projects.
          These interests influence how I think about design, communication, and building tools that feel intuitive to people, not just correct on paper.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re interested in cybersecurity, applied research, or building thoughtful systems with real-world relevance,
          I’d love to connect and exchange ideas.
        </p>

        <p class="about-signoff">Cheers!</p>
